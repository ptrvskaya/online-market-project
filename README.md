It is a Python program that allows users to create an online shopping cart. It uses data classes to store user registration information and product details. The program includes password validation checks and provides a way to deposit funds into the user's account.

Users can add or remove items from the cart, and when they are ready to checkout, they can pay for their order from their account balance. If their account balance is insufficient, they will be prompted to deposit funds before completing their order.

To enhance security, the program includes password strength validation checks, including password length, inclusion of at least one digit and one uppercase and lowercase letter, and exclusion of commonly used passwords.
